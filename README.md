# UCl-Occupancy-Detection-Analyzer
Fully connected neural network; long-short term memory recurrent neural network

SmartSaver is a system for buildings that determines whether one can sit at a desk based on room or table occupancy. SmartSaver can keep track of how long students were sitting at a desk, helping to determine which seats are safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. While our main aim is to save energy, we want to expand our solution to one of the most pressing matters of recent years: COVID-19. SmartSaver can detect which public table is safe to sit at by keeping track of how long people were sitting there.

We aimed to build something thatâ€™s non-intrusive. So, we used sensors that take non-visual data. Our small silicon chips are incredibly easy to install in a room. We preprocessed data from the UCI Machine Learning repository. Next, gave the normalized data to a fully-connected neural network and performed correlation analysis. This information was then used to predict the length of occupancy for a certain room or table.
